#### Thanks to the authors of the tools used in this script.

#### I planned to used it in one of the paid tools but soon realised that the tools I am using in this script are restricted for commercial license. I didn't check it in the first place (my bad). So Removed encrypted script, scrapped paid tool project, open-sourced this script. Script is very simple though. I may update it occassionally.

Initial repo created - A few weeks back below date.
Date - 4 March 2019, Open-sourced
